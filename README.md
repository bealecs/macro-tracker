## üí° Why Focus on Macronutrients?
In the words of Dr. Andrew Huberman, optimizing your macronutrient intake isn't just about body composition‚Äîit's about harnessing the biology of performance. Proper nutrient intake helps regulate metabolism, improve energy levels, and support cognitive function. It's the bridge between feeling sluggish and feeling unstoppable.

The Macro Tracker app aligns with this scientific approach, helping you monitor the variables that matter:

Proteins for muscle growth and repair, ensuring strength and functionality.
Fats for cellular health, hormone regulation, and brain function.
Carbohydrates as the primary energy source for physical and mental activities.
Sugars to maintain energy balance, without overloading the system.
